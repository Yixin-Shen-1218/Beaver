**Current progress discussion**

Different parts members respectively took responsibilities has been integrated, and a demo has been constructed & run.

The results produced by python & displayed in line chart is well, a deviation is exist and is caused by some noises.

A server from Tencent is bought & come into use in order to develop software in winter vacation.

Primary Interim Report has been worked out and send as a copy to the supervisor, a feedback will be send back after 3-4 days.

A dynamic discrete survival model built in python will come out in next week.

**Q&A session**

Q: Should we pay more attention on building dashboard?

A: Dashboard maybe not too important, a great performance or a better chart might be more significant rather than dashboard design.

Q: Do we need to validate the results of stress testing?

A: It's hard to distinguish if the results of stress testing is right for that might requires a substantial financial knowledges. Maybe you can ask risk managers of banks thus they can give a judgement based on their abundant knowledges & experiences.

Q: Can we struct the scenario file by ourselves, or following some principles?

A: Absolutely. And you can take your own numbers of variables in.



**Advices for project**

The result dots in the chart is too big as the instances of calendar time is too much and the results are arranged too dense. Maybe they should be smaller.

User should be able to see a detail result when they put pointers on the dots.

The visualization part could be achieved in multiple ways. Something like log likelihood graph could be applicated. A newly graph is introduced in this meeting.

The report might needs more references. A use of Google Scholar is a great choice. 10+ references at least.

Articles by Breeden, Crook and Allison is suggested as good references. And searching by keyword like "survival" and "credit risk" is a way to get resources, in addition, booking from library.

More technological references & less non-academic references like Wikipedia are expected. However, browsing the references at the bottom of Wikipedia is also a pretty idea.

Citing from blog built by developers is applicated by more people, despite nobody will know where your sources from.

**Plan for next week**

Continue to improve the Interim report

Do more search & add more references
