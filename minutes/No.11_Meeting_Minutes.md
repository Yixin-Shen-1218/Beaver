#### Agenda

**Introduce the progress during winter vacation**

**Show the software functions**

**A quick lesson about log-likelihood model**

**QA session**

#### Progress and Software Functions
The progress in winter vacation is higher than superviser's expection. 
The finished functions meet the requirements.

#### QA
1. Q: Could we modify the given python model?
A: You could add some content in python code, but do not change the mathematical model itself.

2. Q: How to calculate the log-likelihood value at each calendar time?
A: Use the true default rate and predicted default rate of all accounts in one specific calendar time to calculate their likelihood. The smaller the value is, the more accurate our model is.

3. Q: When can we get the true data and models?
A: Next week.


#### Plan
Finish the code part in two weeks.
