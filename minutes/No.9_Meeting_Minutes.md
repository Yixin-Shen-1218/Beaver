**Q&A session**

Q: Interms of Chapter1 of the report, should we add the definitions of concept of dynamic and traditional model?

A: Just introduce the dynamic more.Hence, adding the definition of concept of dynamic model is enough.

**Advices for project**
Clarify the keyword, bacause some teachers without related background knowledge read this report too.

We'd better use conditional functions.

Prevent citing inside the functions. Instead, cite in the clarification of the functions.

Show achievement in Chapter5.
