#### Advices for Docs

1. Regarding to the activity diagram, add a central activity point from which the user can go back to change data, add filters, choose different models to make it less linear
2. May give the user some optional stress testing scenarios when user want to do the stress testing (scenario_1, scenario_2, scenario_3, etc.)
3. Suppose the long data sets are already stored in the end-users' database
4. In the dashboard, basically it should have the PD figure, however there are many other futures like p-value to be added.
5. Regarding to the actors part, it is better to reflect three different identities in the text file, i.e risk manager, model developers, university researchers. But they utilize the same functionalities, in the figure may need not to show that
